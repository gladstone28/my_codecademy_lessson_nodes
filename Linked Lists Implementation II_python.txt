LINKED LISTS: PYTHON
Linked Lists Implementation II
So far we can:

create a new LinkedList using .__init__()
get the head node of the list using .get_head_node()
Next up, weâ€™ll define methods for our LinkedList class that allow us to:

insert a new head node
return all the nodes in the list as a string so we can print them out in the terminal!
